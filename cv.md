About myself 

I worked in culture for many years. The last 10 years have been interested in web development. Now I want to change my profession and get serious about it. For this I have a great desire, a lot of free time and patience.

Skills:
* JavaScript Basics
* GitHub
* HTML CSS3
* PHP

Code example 
```javascript
function addName(a, b) {
	let name = a + b;
	return name;
}

let name = addName('Ivan', 'Vodkin');
```
